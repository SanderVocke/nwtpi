1. OVERVIEW
NWTPI is the Native Window Toolkit C++ API designed for the Raspberry Pi (tm).
This API allow to access to the native Pi video board, headless, meaning without X11 or any other window manager.
It use the Broadcom C API 'DispmanX', and put its use to the background.

NWTPI was evolved in order to get a simple API like the one done for Java through JOGL::NEWT.
